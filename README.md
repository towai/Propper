A simple WEBFISHING mod that allows you to increase the prop limit, because
i want the Prosperous Rod within my lifetime but without resorting to
straight up cheating or save editing.

Your new prop limit is configurable in Tacklebox or via the config file,
and requires a restart to take effect.
